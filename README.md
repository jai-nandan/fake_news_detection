📱 App Overview:
Platform: Android (developed using Java in Android Studio)

Function: Users can enter or paste a news article/headline and the app will determine whether it's real or fake news using AI models.

Core Technology:

Machine Learning trained on a Kaggle fake news dataset

Converted to TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) for lightweight performance on mobile devices

Uses text classification (NLP) models

⚙️ Features:
Real-time fake news prediction directly on the phone (no server needed)

Clean, simple UI for input and output

Trained offline and then integrated using TensorFlow Lite .tflite model

Works without internet after installation

🧠 Model Training:
Used traditional ML/NLP algorithms:

TF-IDF vectorization

Algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or LSTM in training phase

Training done in Jupyter Notebook, then exported to .tflite
